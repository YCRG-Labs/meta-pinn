• Extensive retraining required for each new problem
• No knowledge transfer from previously solved problems  
• Poor rapid adaptation to new physical domains
• Inefficient for few-shot scenarios with minimal data

Problem: Each new physics problem treated as completely independent
Impact: Computational bottleneck for real-world applications
Solution Preview: Our approach achieves 67% reduction in training time""", "pinn_limitations.png"),

• Inefficiency: No leverage of shared fluid dynamics principles
